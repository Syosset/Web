          text: "At Syosset High School, we strive to provide an education that is
          challenging, thorough and useful, in an environment where students find
          joy in learning. We believe high school is a unique experience, valuable
          for its own sake. As individuals, our students deserve the opportunity
          to develop their distinctive talents. While all students should be
          challenged to think for themselves, we encourage them to work together
          to share their talents. Our goal is to create lifelong learners who
          continue to grow and explore long after their last test is taken. It is
          our hope that Syosset students will emerge as discerning, educated
          citizensâ€”with the skills necessary to find success in the university, in
          the workplace, and in all the challenges life offers. Our administration and
          staff serve to model the values and character we expect of our students:
          patience, respect, integrity, dignity and empathy. We share our
          responsibility with parents and our community, and, in turn, hope to
          make Syosset High School students aware of their responsibility and
          connection to the larger world."
